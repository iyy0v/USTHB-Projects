### M1 :
- **LiveScore** : a website about american football where you can find the history of the sport, solve a quiz about it and check out live score of ongoing matches. Made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and XML for data storing. <br /> 
**PS:** You will need to run a live server for the score to be real time. You can use [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) or the VSCode [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
