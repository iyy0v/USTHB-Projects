## Projects List
### L1 :
- **Algo Scripts** (ALGO): scripts written in C where I learned/practiced the basics of algorithmics and coding + a small project for library management.
- **MathProg** (OPM): a project for my Mathematical Programming class which combines three subjects: Primitive Recursive functions, Turing Machines and Mathematical Tasks solved using [Caml](https://caml.inria.fr).

### M1 :
- **LiveScore** (WEB AV): a simple website about american football where you can find the history of the sport, solve a quiz about it and check out live score of ongoing matches. Made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and XML for data storing. <br /> 
**PS:** You will need to run a live server for the score to be real time. You can use [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) or the VSCode [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
- **SortCmp** (CMPLX): a project written in C which contains various sorting algorithms with a timer in order to compare their runtime based on their complexities. There are also some graphs with the results we obtained in our tests.
- **SYS Scripts** (SE): a bunch of C scripts where I explored and learned how to manipulate processes (parent/child), threads, pipes and the way they work while performing certain tasks given as exercises during my practical OS class.
- **Project Plans** (GP): some plans made using [MS Project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/project/project-management-software) for my Project Management class. <br />
**PS:** Some of the earlier versions might have got overwritten.
- **SQL3** (BDA): a project about the management of a database containing gyms data where I explored different aspects of SQL3 including references, nested tables, user-defined types, functions and much more using [Oracle DBXE](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xe.html). I also used UML for modelisation.
- **JUnit** (MODAL): a bunch of Java scripts for testing classes, generating logs, extracting relations between classes and more.
- **PCL Compiler** (COMPIL2): a PCL compiler created from scratch using [C](https://www.mingw-w64.org) + [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex) & [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison) which analyzes a PCL code, creates its Symbol Table, generates its intermediary code in a form of quadruplets, optimizes it then converts it to x86 machine code. <br /> 
**Versions:** GCC 8.2.0 , GNU Flex 2.5.4 ,  GNU Bison 2.4.1
